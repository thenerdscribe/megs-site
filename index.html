      <p>Hi all you yinzers out there (go Steelers!), it’s me, Meg!</p>
      <p>
        I don’t know about you, but my three favorite things in this world are
        sleep, my cats (Jane Fonda and Floyd), and eating at the best
        gluten-free restaurants in the Valley.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s why I started this blog! I’ll write about eazy tips to get eazy
        zzz’s (ha ha ha, get it?).
      </p>
      <p>But I’ll also update it soon with the following guides:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Best Gluten-free Mattresses</li>
        <li>Top 10 Cat Tricks Any Cat Can Do!</li>
        <li>
          The 5 Worst Taylor Swift Songs (and what they say about her fans)!
        </li>
        <li>
          Best Tungsten Rings of 2020 (oh, in case I forgot to mention, I’m an
          heiress to a tungsten empire).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If I’m not writing on my blog, I’m usually gold-panning with my
        ax-throwing boyfriend (shout out to Grant, who is definitely not a cat!)
        or trolling Lili Reinhart on Twitter (‘cause she’s the worst).
      </p>
      <p>This is a photo of me, in case you were curious.</p>
